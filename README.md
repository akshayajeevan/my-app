# MyApp

My personal project to learn something new. Currently adding COVID-19 data and charts. :construction_worker:

Check it out - [here](https://my-app.akshayajeevan.now.sh/) :tada:

## Development server

Clone this repo.

Run `npm i` to get all the node modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Something wrong?

Please raise an issue here.
